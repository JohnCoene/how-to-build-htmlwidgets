<h1>Program</h1>

<h2>What you will learn</h2>

You will learn how to build your own packages for visualisations using [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/). htmlwidgets is the backbone of packages such as [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/), [highcharter](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/), and many others. The aim is that by the end of the workshop you will be able to write your own such packages.

<h2>Methodology</h2>

Learn by doing. I believe, this remains the best way to learn anything. The workshop will therefore have you write a lot of the code.
